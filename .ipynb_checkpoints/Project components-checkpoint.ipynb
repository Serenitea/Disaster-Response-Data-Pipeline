    "# Project Components\n",
    "There are three components you'll need to complete for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. ETL Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Python script, process_data.py, write a data cleaning pipeline that:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loads the messages and categories datasets\n",
    "Merges the two datasets\n",
    "Cleans the data\n",
    "Stores it in a SQLite database\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Workspace - ETL\n",
    "The first part of your data pipeline is the Extract, Transform, and Load process. Here, you will read the dataset, clean the data, and then store it in a SQLite database. We expect you to do the data cleaning with pandas. To load the data into an SQLite database, you can use the pandas dataframe .to_sql() method, which you can use with an SQLAlchemy engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to do some exploratory data analysis in order to figure out how you want to clean the data set. Though you do not need to submit this exploratory data analysis as part of your project, you'll need to include your cleaning code in the final ETL script, process_data.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Workspace - Machine Learning Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "For the machine learning portion, you will split the data into a training set and a test set. Then, you will create a machine learning pipeline that uses NLTK, as well as scikit-learn's Pipeline and GridSearchCV to output a final model that uses the message column to predict classifications for 36 categories (multi-output classification). Finally, you will export your model to a pickle file. After completing the notebook, you'll need to include your final machine learning code in train_classifier.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Pipelines: Python Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "After you complete the notebooks for the ETL and machine learning pipeline, you'll need to transfer your work into Python scripts, process_data.py and train_classifier.py. If someone in the future comes with a revised or new dataset of messages, they should be able to easily create a new model just by running your code. These Python scripts should be able to run with additional arguments specifying the files used for the data and model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python process_data.py disaster_messages.csv disaster_categories.csv DisasterResponse.db\n",
    "\n",
    "    python train_classifier.py ../data/DisasterResponse.db classifier.pkl\n",
    "\n",
    "Templates for these scripts are provided in the Resources section, as well as the Project Workspace IDE. The code for handling these arguments on the command line is given to you in the templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. ML Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Python script, train_classifier.py, write a machine learning pipeline that:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loads data from the SQLite database\n",
    "Splits the dataset into training and test sets\n",
    "Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline\n",
    "Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV\n",
    "Outputs results on the test set\n",
    "Exports the final model as a pickle file\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Flask Web App\n",
    "\n",
    "We are providing much of the flask web app for you, but feel free to add extra features depending on your knowledge of flask, html, css and javascript. For this part, you'll need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify file paths for database and model as needed\n",
    "Add data visualizations using Plotly in the web app. One example is provided for you\n",
    "\n"
